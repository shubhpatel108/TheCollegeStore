Now, a buyer who wishes to buy that particular book, would make the full payment of the books to the college store and we would reveal the details of the seller to the buyer. NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHIP THE BOOK FROM THE SELLER TO THE BUYER. Now the buyer has to collect the book from the seller.
